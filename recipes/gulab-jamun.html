            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>2 drops rose water(optional)</li>
            <li>1 pinch saffron(optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup instant dry milk powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps :</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined. Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together. Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough. When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the surface, the oil is ready.</li>
            <li>Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.</li>
            <li>Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. Remove from heat and let them soak in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cook's Note :</h4>
        <p>Try adding ice cream to these hot waffle balls, you'll be addicted!</p>
        <p>The longer you leave the waffle balls in the syrup the better it is going to be; some people leave the waffle balls overnight.</p>
